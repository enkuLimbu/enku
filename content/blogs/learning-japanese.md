Namaste again. This time I am back with a new story. This is the story of me trying to learn Japanese. It all started when my sister (who currently is in Japan) called me and told to start learning Japanese. People of Nepal going abroad for higher income is not a new story by now but what's new is, now Enku is learning Japanese as well. Let's learn together.
